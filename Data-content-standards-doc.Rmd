This report was produced using data content from the January 2024 snapshot of Central Biotics on `r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')`. Data from past years were also included in some figures for a multi-year comparison.

# A. All element global records should have: 

## 1. A global conservation status assessment.
